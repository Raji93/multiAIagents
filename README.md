# üîß Multi-Agents system using Azure AI + Semantic Kernel 

This project showcases a powerful multi-agent system using [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and Azure AI, designed to automatically analyze logs, identify system issues, and suggest or apply DevOps resolutions using intelligent agents.

## What It Does

This solution simulates a real-world scenario where logs are processed by two collaborative agents:

- **Incident Manager Agent**: Analyzes log files and recommends corrective actions like restarting services, rolling back transactions, redeploying resources, or increasing quotas.
- **DevOps Assistant Agent**: Receives recommendations and invokes the appropriate resolution function (e.g., restart a service or escalate the issue).

### ‚ú® Highlights
- Uses **Azure OpenAI** with `AzureAIAgent` via **Semantic Kernel**
- Implements **multi-agent orchestration** with:
  - Sequential role selection strategy
  - Termination strategy based on natural language
- Incorporates **custom plugins** to simulate DevOps tasks (e.g., restarting a service)
- Provides a great foundation for **AIOps** automation

## Architecture

```plaintext
Log File ‚ûú Incident Manager (LLM) ‚ûú Action Recommendation ‚ûú DevOps Assistant (LLM) ‚ûú Resolution Execution
```

Agents communicate back and forth in a structured group chat until resolution is reached or escalation is needed.

## üõ† Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Azure Subscription with OpenAI resource deployed
- Log files to process (`/sample_logs`)
- Git clone or upload this code to Azure Cloud Shell / VS Code

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add your Azure credentials and configuration via environment variables or `DefaultAzureCredential`.

### Run the Project

```bash
python main.py
```

You‚Äôll see the agents take turns analyzing logs and applying DevOps solutions.

## üìÅ File Structure

- `main.py`: Core orchestration and agent chat loop
- `LogFilePlugin`: Reads logs for analysis
- `DevopsPlugin`: Contains mock functions like `restart_service`, `rollback_transaction`, etc.
- `SelectionStrategy` & `TerminationStrategy`: Custom multi-agent behavior logic
- `sample_logs/`: Source logs used by the system

## Technologies Used

- [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/)
- [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
- [Azure Identity](https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/)
- Python `asyncio` and `aio` libraries

## üóÇ Use Cases

- AIOps & automated incident resolution
- Root cause analysis using LLM agents
- IT Ops workflow automation
- Learning Semantic Kernel agent orchestration

## Future Enhancements

- Add more DevOps action plugins
- Integrate with real-time log streams (e.g., Azure Monitor, Grafana)
- Dashboard for tracking agent decisions
